The attached Matlab code provide functions and a graphical interface to calculate superconducting Helmholtz coils.

It is based on the paper titled "Design and simulation of a superconducting magnetic system for milli/microrobotics applications"
by Julien Leclerc, Aaron T. Becker, Nikolaos V. Tsekos, Kevin Berger and Jean Leveque (paper currently under review for publication in JMRR).

To start the graphical interface:
_open Matlab and move to the progam folder.
_run UI.m
